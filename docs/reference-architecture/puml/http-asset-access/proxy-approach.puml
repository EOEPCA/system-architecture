title Http Asset Access - Proxy Approach

actor User as user
control IAM as IAM
queue "Processing" as ADES
entity job as job
control "Data Gateway\n(STAC server mode)" as dgw
participant Catalogue as cat
database Storage as storage

user -> IAM : Authenticate (OIDC)
IAM -> user: Bearer token (JWT)
note left
JWT token is used
to authenticate user
on all subsequent requests
end note

user -> dgw: STAC API Item search (for input data selection)
dgw -> cat: forwarded query
note right
			JWT bearer token is
			forwarded to get private
			collections access
end note
cat -> dgw: STAC items matching query
dgw -> dgw: rewrite STAC items' HREF\nto point to data gateway
dgw -> user: STAC items

alt user wants to download/access data locally
	user -> user: extract URL from STAC Item entry (href)
	note right
		this link will always be
		an HTTPs link to the
		data gateway service
	end note
	loop for each product to access
		user -> dgw: access product (via GDAL or curl)
		note right
			JWT bearer token is
			included here in HTTPs
			request header
		end note
		dgw -> storage: get data
		note right
			according to storage, temporary
			credentials can be created from
			the user JWT or internal platform
			credentials can be used
		end note
		storage -> dgw: data
		dgw -> user: data
	end loop
	
else user wants to process data
  user -> ADES: Submit processing request\n(STAC is provided in input)
  ADES -> job: job is sumitted (JWT token is forwarded)
	job -> job: extract URL from STAC Item entry (href)
	note right
		this link will always be
		an HTTPs link to the
		data gateway service
	end note
	loop for each product to access
		job -> dgw: access product (via GDAL or curl)
		note right
			JWT bearer token is
			included here in HTTPs
			request header
		end note
		dgw -> storage: get data
		note right
			according to storage, temporary
			credentials can be created from
			the user JWT or internal platform
			credentials can be used
		end note
		storage -> dgw: data
		dgw -> job: data
	end loop
	job -> job: generate outputs
	job -> dgw: push outputs (data and metadata)
		note right
	    JWT token is used here,
			a STAC representation
			of the output would be
			probably needed
	  end note
	dgw -> storage: push output data
		note right
			according to storage, temporary
			credentials can be created from
			the user JWT or internal platform
			credentials can be used
		end note
	dgw --> cat: (optional) the STAC outputs are\npushed into the catalogue  
end
