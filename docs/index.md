# Introduction

This document provides the EOEPCA+ Reference Architecture – which is defined as a set of building blocks.

The building blocks are designed as self-standing reusable services that, where possible, provide open standard interfaces. They are designed to provide complementary services that can be combined to provide an exploitation platform solution.

The architecture has been designed in response to use cases [[AD01]][ad01] that are derived from the needs of Utilsation Domains that act as a stakeholders in the evolving architecture – in particular ESA projects:

* **APEx** - Application Propagator Environment
* **EarthCODE** - Earth Science Collaborative Open Development Environment

The architecture is presented in this document as a complete Reference Architecture – followed by specific architectures that tailor the architecture to each of the utilisation domains.
